Building the Soil Maker Box (see picture and design further down this page) takes a fair amount of time, skill and tools. So before you launch into that, watch this short video on the Soil Maker Cylinder to see if it's perhaps more suitable for you:

  This is the perfect lid for the soil maker cylinder. This lid is larger than what’s available in most hardware stores and is also green. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BMTR14Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=makesoil0f-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00BMTR14Q&linkId=21bd2966b99ec59a6e54e34e04eca83f" target="_blank">Please use this link to purchase</a> (and choose MakeSoil as your charity of choice and Amazon will make a small donation to MakeSoil at no cost to you if you haven’t already chosen a Smile Charity).

Build it yourself, have someone build it for you, or if you're a woodworker consider building it for other people, and even selling it. All we ask is that if you make any profits from our design, please make a donation to MakeSoil to show your appreciation.
