    The "Cylinder" is the most minimalist, easy-build bin we can think of. It's literally just a roll of wire mesh (a.k.a hardware cloth) with a lid to keep out animals and rain. Here's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rubbermaid-Commercial-Products-FG264560WHT-Heavy-Duty/dp/B00RD9H5T0/ref=sr_1_1?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=makesoil0f-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=bba7675e003b91b6823284ba89f1e470&camp=1789&creative=9325" target="_blank"> link to a lid</a> that's larger than what's sold in most hardware stores (go for the 44 or 55 gallon size as the size of the lid determines the size of the cylinder).
