MakeSoil matches ‘Soil Makers’ (people who compost) with nearby ‘Soil Supporters’ (people who contribute scraps). By doing this at scale, worldwide, we are creating a distributed network for organics recycling. This prevents greenhouse gas emissions, captures carbon, puts nutrients back into the local food system, and at a far lower cost than traditional curbside pick-up programs. On top of that, "making soil" is an incredibly simple yet powerfully humanizing and unifying act, helping to not just repair the Earth's Biosphere, but also to repair the rampant social division facing human civilization today.

# What is a soil site?

A soil site is a place where people come together to turn their food scraps into soil. Soil sites are hosted by Soil Makers — which is somoene who knows (or is learning) how to make soil. All that is needed is a [Soil Maker Box](https://www.makesoil.org/diy), or equivalent setup, located in a backyard (front-yard, side-yard), community garden, place of worship, place of work (anywhere really!), which is then registered [here](https://www.makesoil.org/create-soil-site).

MakeSoil then works to match nearby neighbors to those soil sites, making it safe and easy for all to participate. Once neighbors join and begin bringing their scraps, we call them a Soil Supporter.

# How should I store my food scraps?

In most cases you can store them in any container right on your counter-top. In that case it's best to not seal the container but to cover it with cloth or otherwise maintain some airflow. You can always keep your container in the refrigerator for many days, or indefinitely in the freezer, until you're ready to visit your soil site.

# I want to be a Soil Maker. How do I make soil?

There are many different ways to make soil. However, we consider the thermophilic, microbial soil-making process - commonly referred to as ‘hot’ composting - to be the most versatile and robust. In this process, the soil site could ideally reach temperatures of around 130°F (54°C), supporting many different microbes as they voraciously chew and digest the materials in a soil site, which is what ultimately turns those materials into what we recognize as soil.

This ‘hot’ process is able to handle most typical household waste, as well as a diversity of inputs from neighbors and the surrounding community e.g. coffee shops, restaurants, workplaces etc. Depending on the the inputs and the process used, the process will take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.

Then there are 4 general principles to keep in mind when making soil:

<div style="overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative;height:0;">

</div>

## 1) The Carbon to Nitrogen ratio

There should be approximately 3 parts ‘brown’ or ‘dry’ stuff (e.g. sawdust, dry leaves and paper) for every 1 part ‘green’ or ‘wet’ stuff (e.g. banana peels, apple cores, coffee grounds). This will quickly become intuitive: If it’s too moist and starting to smell, you need more brown/dry (high-carbon) materials. If it’s dry and lifeless and not turning into soil, you need more green/wet (high-nitrogen) materials.

## 2) Airflow

There should be sufficient airflow through the pile, and generally the more, the better. This can be achieved, for instance, by using a container which allows air to flow, such as the options on our [DIY page](https://www.makesoil.org/diy).

## 3) Moisture

The pile should be sufficiently moist, but not too wet. Covering the pile or at the very least keeping a layer of high-carbon matter on top, will help prevent your pile from becoming dried out in hot, sunny conditions, or from becoming too moist when it rains.

If the pile remains too dry, either add more moist, high-nitrogen scraps (e.g. coffee grounds) or water.

## 4) Volume

One last point to consider is that you can’t make soil in a coffee cup! For a hot process, there needs to be a sufficient thermal mass - ensure your pile is at least a few feet (one metre) in diameter.

# What materials can I make soil out of?

Making soil is a recipe. And essentially, you can make soil out of almost anything that was once alive (think, almost anything other than plastic, metal, and glass). For example, one simple recipe might be leftover food scraps and leaves from a tree.

Still, different Soil Makers will likely have personal preferences and may not accept certain materials. Many Soil Makers don’t accept meat, grease, dairy, bones. And some won't accept cooked food, bread, pasta etc. — even though, with a high level of skill, you can make soil even out of these; but it will require a pest-proof container and achieving high temperatures via the thermophilic (hot) method.

Some Soil Makers don’t accept citrus, onions or garlic. This is only a problem if they are using worms to digest the materials in their pile instead of a thermophilic process.

Many Soil Makers don’t accept glossy paper e.g. junk mail because it takes a long time to break down and may contain metals or chemicals used in printing or laminating. For similar reasons, many Soil Makers don’t accept non-organic (conventionally-grown) food waste, due to contamination with glyphosate (e.g. Roundup).

Many Soil Makers don’t accept human waste or pet waste, because they may contain parasites or diseases that cannot be reliably avoided except with the highest level of soil-making skill.

# Do I need any special equipment to make soil?

This depends what pests you have to guard against.

If you have no pests, then you don’t strictly need any special equipment. You could just mound up your scraps into a pile. However, you’ll need to keep your pile mounded, so you may soon find that some sort of container would be useful. With no pests, a simple container made from wooden pallets and some chicken wire is perfectly fine. If you have raccoons, you might need a closed container that can only be opened by a human.

On our [DIY page](https://www.makesoil.org/diy), you will find some options, ranging from the quick and easy "Soil Maker Cylinder", to the more complex "Soil Maker Box" (pictured below).

# Will my pile smell bad?

Only if something is wrong. Maybe there’s too much nitrogen, not enough airflow, or it’s too wet. However, a well-managed pile should never smell bad.

# Will my pile attract pests e.g. rats?

This will be minimal if you use a pest-proof bin and also get the pile hot enough. You can also avoid attracting pests by burying your freshest scraps in the middle of your pile, covering your pile with a ‘carbon seal’ (e.g. soil and dry leaves), and making your container secure.

# How can I get more materials being contributed to my pile?

You can share a direct link to your soil site on your social media e.g. neighborhood Facebook, Nextdoor, WhatsApp groups etc. Each soil site also has a printable poster with a QR code, that you can post up, or distribute as flyers, as well as other sharing features.

You can also take the initiative to, for example, ask your local coffee store to give you their used coffee grounds. Many stores will happily do so!

# Should the pile get lots of sun?

Full sun can help the pile warm up in wintery places that get down to freezing. Otherwise full sun may dry out the pile and shorten the life of the Soil Maker Box.

In general, the Soil Maker Box should be in a pleasing spot that entices people to use it, whether sunny or in partial shade.

# What should I do with my finished soil?

Firstly, you won't end up with nearly as much as you think. However, once you've made some soil, you may want to grow something yourself e.g. a plant. It can be very rewarding to grow your own food, or even just indoor plants to liven up your living space. Otherwise, you will almost certainly have a neighbor or community garden nearby who would love to have some.

# How does MakeSoil compare with using a composting pick-up service?

Pick-up services can of course be a convenient option for many people, and MakeSoil loves to work with both municipalities and waste companies to support and supplement what they do. However, the MakeSoil approach is to create a decentralized network of soil sites where citizens' scraps are composted at the most local level possible, saving time, fuel and money while also building greater community resilience.

Watching your food waste turn back into living soil completes an essential feedback loop which suddenly transforms your understanding and relationship with the environment. When somebody else takes away your food waste and composts it for you out of sight, it's certainly better than those scraps being sent to landfill. However, you do miss out on the transformative experience that can only come through completing such feedback loops.

We live today in a box and bin culture. We click a button on the internet, a box arrives on our doorstep, we play with it for a while or it breaks, and then we throw it in a bin and someone takes it away. This keeps us from understanding the system we live in as a whole. MakeSoil is founded on the insight that it’s only by witnessing and fully participating - from start to finish - in regenerative acts like soil making, that we can begin to truly recognize how our system works, and the role we play in this system as individuals.

# What if I'm a novice Soil Maker? Can I still host a soil site?

Absolutely. Making soil is a process that is easy to learn, and that you will enjoy mastering for years to come. Relatively few people alive today have developed this much-needed skill and there’s no better time than now to start learning. Plus, if you need help, consider inviting someone to be a co-Soil-Maker at your soil site with you, as each soil site does allow multiple Soil Makers.

You can also let people know in the description of your soil site that you’re still learning and would love some help learning how to make soil. You’ll be surprised how happy people will be to help share their experience and expertise with you.

While you’re just getting started, you can also set your soil site to only allow people to join and start bringing their scraps once you have approved them. And you can set a limit to the number of Soil Supporters you accept (it could be as low as 1 or 2), so your soil site won’t get overwhelmed while you are still developing your soil-making skills.

# What if I live in an apartment complex? Can I still host a soil site?

Yes. An apartment complex can actually be an ideal place to start a soil site. In fact, our first ever soil site was started in an apartment complex!

Just approach your property manager, or even show them MakeSoil, and let them know that this will be a great way to build community amongst residents while also reducing waste going to landfills (and possibly their waste disposal fees!).

# What if I don’t have access to garden space? Where can I host a soil site?

There are lots of places where soil can be made, even in a dense city. Even if you don’t own any land or property yourself, you just need to be resourceful. After all, as you can see from the image of an urban soil site below, it doesn’t take much space to make soil. Could you get access to your neighbor’s yard, or a spare patch of nearby community land - perhaps some land that belongs to a church or local business?

# What if I travel a lot. Can I still be a Soil Maker?

Yes. Consider ‘promoting’ a Soil Supporter that you trust, to become a fellow Soil Maker. This will give them the ability to help manage your site and its participants while you’re gone.

# Can a project or organization create and host one or more soil site(s)?

Yes, your organization can create and host any number of soil sites. Just register your organization’s soil site(s) and feel free to let the public know who is behind your soil sites, by including your logo and link to your website and social media, in your soil site's profile.

# Can I earn income as a Soil Maker?

While not supported by the platform, do consider asking your neighbors to help support your work with a monthly donation or fee. We find that many neighbors really do value you as their Soil Maker and are happy to support.

We're also finding that artisanal soil is becoming a valuable product, which means that Soil Makers producing high-quality soil may be able to sell it.


# How did MakeSoil start?

In 2009, MakeSoil founder [Josh Whiton](http://joshwhiton.com/) was living in a suburban apartment block in the city of Raleigh, North Carolina in the United States. He noticed that all the residents there were just throwing all their waste into the trash, which would be taken away to sprawling landfill sites outside the city.

Josh was sure there was a more beautiful way to do things. So, one day, he found some discarded wooden pallets, fixed them together to make a compost bin outside his building, and went door-to-door inviting his fellow residents to donate their food scraps to him.

People soon got the idea, and were glad to have a clear, simple and practical way to do something good for the planet. And as Josh began to master the art of making soil, they were even more amazed to see how quickly all sorts of organic materials could be turned back into rich, living soil.

And now that they had direct access to good quality soil, it wasn't long before they all came together to create a beautiful community garden too (see video below), all starting from simple food scraps.

Josh was himself amazed to watch all of this unfold, as he gradually began to fully realise the great potential of this simple yet profound act - of making soil together - to inspire people, to bring them together, and to repair our relationship with our planet, all at the same time:

"I'm still in awe of the transformations I saw in people as they began to participate in the process and have that experience of making soil. It was unexpected and profound. Despite having been the CEO of a successful tech startup, building that compost bin and inviting people to use it, is perhaps the simplest thing I've ever done that had the greatest benefit."

It's the simple desire to share this experience, that gave birth to MakeSoil.
