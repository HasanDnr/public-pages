### Have Amazon Donate on Your Behalf
When you shop at Amazon, you can direct a portion of **Amazon's profits** to supporting MakeSoil — at absolutely _no cost to you_. It really adds up, so if you want to help the Planet with every purchase, please take 2 mins to do this now!

Note: you'll need to configure your computer's web browser and the Amazon App if you shop using both.

<details>
<summary>Amazon App (iPhone/Android)</summary>

- Open the Amazon App and select the ≡ at the bottom right corner of the screen
- Then scroll to the bottom and choose “Settings”
- Scroll down and select “AmazonSmile”, then click the yellow “Turn on Amazon Smile” button. 
- Lastly, after the confirmation screen that says “Welcome!”, scroll down to the bottom of the page, select “Choose your charity” or “Change your charity”, and search for MakeSoil. Hit “select” next to our name.

<summary>Web Browser (Desktop / Laptop)</summary>

- First set MakeSoil as your charity of choice by clicking <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/ch/82-4769177">here.</a> 

- Then install one of the un-obtrusive browser extensions below. These extensions do **not** collect any of your data — they only redirect Amazon to Amazon's <em>Smile</em> program so you don't have to remember to, which does _not_ alter your Amazon shopping experience in any way.
